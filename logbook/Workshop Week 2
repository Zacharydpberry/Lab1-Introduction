Task 1 - Blind Spot Test 

Really interesting how the brain can fill in the blind spot based on the surrounding information. Reminds me of the spot healing tool in Photoshop.
Observing the blind spot with the left eye is strange as you can only ever see it blurred - because the blind spot is of course outside of the 
fovea region and in your peripheral vision.
