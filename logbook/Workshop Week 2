Task 1 - Blind Spot Test 

It is interesting how the brain can fill in the blind spot based on the surrounding information. Reminds me of the spot-healing tool in Photoshop.
Observing the blind spot with the left eye is strange as you can only ever see it blurred - because the blind spot is of course outside of the 
fovea region and in your peripheral vision. 

Task 2 - Ishihara Colour Test

I got them all correct! 

Task 3 - Reverse Colour 

Unfortunately, this effect didn't work - I wonder if it's because of the ambient light colour of the room, and it being slightly yellow.
This effect works because the cone cells in your eyes, or particularly the ones that detect green and yellow, become fatigued after looking at 
the image for a prolonged period of time. When I suddenly shift my gaze, the cone cells which detect red and blue are not fatigued, but the 
green and yellow ones are. The brain interprets the difference in signals between the red and blue cones, and the green and yellow, as the 
opposite colour, meaning I see the regular American flag.
